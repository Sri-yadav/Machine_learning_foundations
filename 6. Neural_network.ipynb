    "- **Exploding Gradient:**\n",
    "  - Easier to handle\n",
    "  - Techniques: Gradient clipping, L1/L2 regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vanishing Gradient:**\n",
    "  - More challenging\n",
    "  - Causes very small gradients → parameters stop updating → training halts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Vanishing Gradient Happens\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neural networks are trained using **backpropagation**:\n",
    "  - Uses the **chain rule** to compute gradients layer by layer.\n",
    "- Traditional activations (e.g., hyperbolic tangent) have gradients in (0,1).\n",

    "# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why CNNs?\n",
    "\n",
    "- MLPs grow **very fast** in parameters with more layers.\n",
    "- Adding a 1000-unit layer adds **over 1 million parameters**.\n",
    "- Image inputs are **high-dimensional**, making MLPs **hard to optimize**.\n",
    "- CNNs reduce parameters drastically **without losing much accuracy**.\n",
    "- Especially useful in **image and text processing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition Behind CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nearby pixels in images often represent the **same type of info** (eg, sky, water, etc).\n",
    "- Exceptions are edges where different objects meet.\n",
    "- CNNs learn to detect **regions and edges** to recognize objects.\n",
    "- Example: detecting skin regions + edges (blue colour) → likely a face on sky background.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How CNNs Work: Moving Window Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split image into **small square patches**.\n",
    "- Train multiple small regression models on patches.\n",
    "- Each model detects a **specific pattern** (sky, grass, edges).\n",
    "- Each model learns parameters of a **filter matrix F** (e.g., 3×3).\n",
    "\n",
    "## CNN Layer Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- One CNN layer = multiple filters + biases.\n",
    "- Filters **slide (convolve)** across the image.\n",
    "- Convolution + bias → passed through **non-linearity (ReLU)**.\n",
    "- Output: one matrix per filter → stacked as a **volume**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple CNN Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next layer convolves the **volume** output of previous layer.\n",
    "- Convolution on volume = sum of convolutions on individual matrices.\n",
